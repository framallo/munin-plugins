Introduction
------------

This is my collection of munin plugins that I use to monitor production servers.
This servers include the following services:
- Nginx 
- Multiple virtual hosts
- Rails applications
- Static web sites
- Git repositories

Requirements
------------

- awk
- ps -oe support

Install
-------

This guide will allow you to install the plugins on ubuntu 10.04 LTS.
However, It may work on other debian / ubuntu distribution 

In order to install this scripts you need to enable the plugins on each munin-node.

  # Set up nginx plugins
  cp nginx_* /usr/share/munin/plugins
  for file in `ls /usr/share/munin/plugins/nginx_*`
    do
    ln -s $file /etc/munin/plugins
  done

  # Set up users plugins
  cp byuser_* /usr/share/munin/plugins
  for file in `ls /usr/share/munin/plugins/byuser_*`
    do
    ln -s $file /etc/munin/plugins
  done

Now you need to set up the plugins by setting the users you want to monitor.
Edit the file /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node

  [byuser_cpu]
  env.USERS "user_app1 user_app2"

  [byuser_mem]
  env.USERS "user_app1 user_app2"

Now you need to restart munin-node

  service munin-node restart

Later check on your munin server.


Supported plugins
-----------------

We recommend the following plugins:

- postgres_*

To install this plugins run:

  # Set up postgres_* plugins
  for file in `ls /usr/share/munin/plugins/postgres_*`
    do
    ln -s $file /etc/munin/plugins
  done


Extra plugins
-------------

Notice that ubuntu 10.04 includes extra plugins that you can install
