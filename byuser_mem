# Plugin to monitor Memory usage, for a selected set of users
#
# Usage: Place in /etc/munin/node.d/ (or link it there  using ln -s)
#        Add this to your /etc/munin/plugin-conf.d/munin-node:
#		[byuser_mem]
#		env.USERS root yann
#
#	 root and yann being a list of the users to monitor.
#	 You need to also make sure that awk is installed
#
# 2011-09-08 v 1.3.2 Federico Ramallo
#				- adapated to track memory
#
# 2008-12-08 v 1.3.1 Hanisch Elián:
#				- support for dots in user names.
#				- fix labels
#
# 2008-12-01 v 1.3 Hanisch Elián:
#				- fixes, refactoring and code cleanup
#				- Users that use cpu but aren't in the USERS env var
#				are plotted as "others", set others.graph to 'no' if
#				you	don't want this.
#
# 2008-03-20 v 1.2 fireball:	fixed minor screwup, works now ^^
#
# 2008-01-09 v 1.1 fireball:	fixed "-" in usernames, those get replaced by "_" now.
#				set usernames in config accordingly (that is with _)
#
#
# Parameters understood:
#
#       config   (required)
#       autoconf (optional - used by munin-config)
